# skill-swap
The SkillSwap project aims to create a full-stack web application that connects people based on the skills they can teach and the skills they want to learn. It works as a Crowd-Powered Skill Exchange Network, where users can find learning partners instead of hiring tutors.
The platform will allow users to:
•	Create a profile listing the skills they can teach and the ones they want to learn.
•	Find compatible users through a smart matching system that pairs people with complementary skills.
•	Communicate via a simple messaging system.
•	Make optional payments using a safe test-mode payment system powered by Stripe.
Unlike traditional tutoring websites, SkillSwap focuses on community-driven learning — it’s about sharing knowledge, not selling it.
2.3 Objectives
The main objectives of the project are to:
•	Build a complete and functional MVP that demonstrates real-world full-stack development.
•	Implement an intelligent matching algorithm to connect compatible learners and teachers.
•	Showcase the integration of frontend (Next.js) and backend (Django REST Framework).
•	Include a dummy payment flow using Stripe for optional paid sessions.
•	Provide a clean and user-friendly interface for users to explore and interact.
